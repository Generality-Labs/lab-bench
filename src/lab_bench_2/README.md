## Usage

First, install dependencies:

```bash
uv sync
```

Then run evaluations:

```bash
uv run inspect eval lab_bench_2/lab_bench_2 --model openai/gpt-5-nano
```

You can also import tasks as Python objects:

```python
from inspect_ai import eval
from lab_bench_2 import lab_bench_2
eval(lab_bench_2)
```

After running evaluations, view logs with:

```bash
uv run inspect view
```

If you don't want to specify `--model` each time, create a `.env` file:

```bash
INSPECT_EVAL_MODEL=anthropic/claude-opus-4-1-20250805
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<anthropic-api-key>
```

## Parameters

### `lab_bench_2`

- `tag` (str): Which LAB-Bench 2 subset to run. Supported tags: ``cloning``, ``dbqa2``, ``figqa2`` (and ``figqa2-img`` / ``figqa2-pdf``), ``litqa3``, ``patentqa``, ``protocolqa2``, ``seqqa2``, ``sourcequality``, ``suppqa2``, ``tableqa2`` (and ``tableqa2-img`` / ``tableqa2-pdf``), ``trialqa``. (default: `'litqa3'`)
- `mode` (Mode): How a question's data files are delivered to the model. A no-op for tags without files (such as litqa3). Options: ``file``: Files uploaded via API. PDFs/images attached as context; other files as document attachments., ``inject``: Text file contents concatenated into the prompt as text., ``retrieve``: Only file names/stems are given; prompt instructs the agent to retrieve the necessary sequences or data from a source of its choosing. File contents are withheld. (default: `'inject'`)
- `solver` (Solver | None): The solver to run. Defaults to ``bare()`` (the benchmark's "bare" configuration: a plain single-turn ``generate()``) when not provided. Pass any Inspect solver to override, e.g. ``-T solver=bare`` on the CLI. (default: `None`)

## Dataset

This eval uses the public `EdisonScientific/labbench2` dataset on Hugging Face, pinned to a specific commit for reproducibility.

For file-bearing tags, the loader filters out questions that don't opt into
the requested `mode` (per each question's `QuestionMode` flags in the HF
data). 

** Relationship between the tag and mode parameters**

Tags describe groups of samples/questions whilst mode describes how data files are uploaded. Not every sample is compatible with each mode of data uploading; if incompatible they are not loaded into the eval. 
Each sample in the dataset contains flags for compatible modes - this may change and sample counts can be verified by running with the configuration you intend before drawing conclusions from sample counts.

For most tags, those that uses files requires the `file` mode. For example; 

`uv run inspect eval lab_bench_2/lab_bench_2 -T tag=sourcequality -T mode=retrieve`

 Will result in no samples being loaded in. This is also true for tags protocolqa2`,`sourcequality`, `figqa2-img`, `figqa2-pdf`, `tableqa2-img`, `tableqa2-pdf`.
 
Note that the base `figqa2`, `tableqa2`, and `suppqa2` tags have no files (mode is a no-op). Their image/PDF variants do have files and are impacted by the above.

`seqqa2` is the exception: all of its samples are compatible with `file` and `inject`, while only a
subset of this tag can be used with`retrieve` (so `mode="retrieve"` loads fewer samples). 

## Scoring

There are different scoring methods for the tags.
Some tags are scored deterministically (see x and y) but most are graded by an LLM judge. The judge compares the solver's answer to
the reference, accepting semantically or numerically equivalent answers, and
returns one of `correct` / `incorrect` / `unsure`; a `correct` verdict scores
1.0 and everything else (including unparseable or empty judgements) scores 0.0.
Reported metrics are `accuracy` and `stderr`.

The judge requests **structured output** (a typed `result` / `rationale`
schema), so the verdict is read from a typed field rather than scraped from
prose. If the grader's provider doesn't support structured output, it falls back
to parsing a `result:` line from the response.

The judge prompt varies by tag: most tags use the default semantic prompt;
`dbqa2` (database access) uses a recall-based variant that marks an answer
correct when it recovers the expected reference values; and the figure, table,
and supplement tags (`figqa2*`, `tableqa2*`, `suppqa2`) use an exact-match
variant for numeric answers.

The `cloning` tag is not graded by an LLM judge: it is scored deterministically
by labbench2's reward pipeline, which parses the submitted protocol, executes it
(including PCR simulation), and compares the result to the reference assembly via
sequence-similarity and restriction-digest checks.
PCR simulation runs a small Go binary that labbench2 compiles on first use, so a
Go toolchain (1.21+) must be available on the host the first time you score
`cloning`; the compiled binary is then cached inside the installed package and
reused. To install Go: `brew install go` (macOS), `sudo apt install golang-go` (Linux),
or <https://go.dev/dl/>. Without Go, protocol execution fails gracefully: PCR-based
samples score 0.0 with an explanatory reason rather than crashing the run.

The `seqqa2` tag is also scored deterministically. A
per-question validator (selected by the question's `type`) checks the answer
extracted via that question's `answer_regex`; extraction tolerates line-wrapped
or whitespace-separated sequences.

The judge model is selected via the `grader` model role and defaults to
`anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5` at temperature 0. Override it on the command line,
for example:

```bash
uv run inspect eval lab_bench_2/lab_bench_2 \
  --model openai/gpt-5-nano \
  --model-role grader=anthropic/claude-opus-4-1-20250805
```

## Attribution

This evaluation depends on the reference implementation's
[`labbench2`](https://github.com/EdisonScientific/labbench2) package for its
deterministic scientific scoring functions (used by the sequence and cloning
tags). That code is licensed **CC BY-SA 4.0**. We pull it in as a dependency —
pinned to a specific commit in `pyproject.toml` (`[tool.uv.sources]`) — rather
than vendoring (copying) the code into this repository.
