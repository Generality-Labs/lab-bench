"""LAB-Bench 2: a benchmark of biology research tasks (arXiv:2604.09554).

A single parameterized task selects a dataset `tag` and a file-delivery `mode`,
and accepts an optional `solver` (defaulting to the benchmark's "bare"
single-turn `generate()`).

    Args:
        tag: Which LAB-Bench 2 subset to run. Supported tags: ``cloning``,
            ``dbqa2``, ``figqa2`` (and ``figqa2-img`` / ``figqa2-pdf``),
            ``litqa3``, ``patentqa``, ``protocolqa2``, ``seqqa2``,

            ``tableqa2-pdf``), ``trialqa``.
        mode: How a question's data files are delivered to the model. A no-op
            for tags without files (such as litqa3). Options:

            - ``file``: Files uploaded via API. PDFs/images attached as
              context; other files as document attachments.
            - ``inject``: Text file contents concatenated into the prompt as
              text.
            - ``retrieve``: Only file names/stems are given; prompt instructs
              the agent to retrieve the necessary sequences or data from a
              source of its choosing. File contents are withheld.
        solver: The solver to run. Options:

            - ``bare``: a plain single-turn `generate()`.
            - ``tools``: the server-side agentic configuration. The model
            is given provider-native, **server-side** tools — WebSearch and
            CodeExecution — and runs Inspect's tool-use loop
